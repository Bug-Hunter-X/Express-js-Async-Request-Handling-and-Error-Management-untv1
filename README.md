# Express.js Async Request Handling and Error Management

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications related to asynchronous request handling and improper error management.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that handles POST requests to the `/data` endpoint. It processes incoming data asynchronously using a `processData` function.  However, the error handling within the callback function of `processData` is incomplete. If an error occurs during processing, it's logged to the console, but the response sent to the client is generic and doesn't provide specific details about the error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version. It enhances error handling by providing more informative error messages to the client and properly using HTTP status codes to indicate the nature of the error.
